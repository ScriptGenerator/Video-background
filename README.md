# Video BG
This repository is about simply making windows backgrounds a video instead of a picture,
the python file takes a video and break it down to frames and save these frames as a jpg files to a folder.
Then comes the c file and rapidly takes each frame and set it as a background image so it looks as a video.
if you think about it thats the idea of a video, just a lot of frames that are being rendered so fast and that's what the c file doing.
